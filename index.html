  <div id="map2id"></div>

  <figcaption>Map calculates its percentages per 100k people. Information gathered from the <a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/gun-violence-by-state/">World Population Review.</a></figcaption>

  <p>At a national perspective, Alaska is not only the leading state in highest numbers of gun ownership but highest number of deaths by guns as well. This map of the United States highlights the top 20 states with the highest death rates from guns. If clicked on each marker, the name of the state pops up along with its ranking in the list and the rate mentioned. The number one state, Alaska, however, is not shown initially on the map but can be seen if zoomed out.</p>
